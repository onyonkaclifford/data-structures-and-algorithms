# Data structures
A data structure is a concrete implementation of the organisation of data and the set of operations
that can be performed on the data for efficient access and modification.

Examples: array, linked list.

# Abstract data types
An abstract data type is a logical model that defines a set of high level operations that can be
performed on data, without specifying a specific implementation to be used in organising the data.
An abstract data type provides an interface that's used to manipulate data, but doesn't specify the
implementation used to organise the data. An underlying data structure or another abstract data type 
object may be used to organise the data.

Examples: stack, queue, deque.

## Tests
To run tests: `python -m doctest -v *.py`
